# VoiceLink Research - Step 01: Explore Windows SAPI
# ============================================================================
# 
# PURPOSE: Understand how Windows discovers and uses TTS voices.
# This is exactly what Thorium Reader (and any SAPI app) does internally.
#
# WHAT WE LEARNED:
# 
# 1. SAPI voices are registered in the Windows Registry under:
#    HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Speech\Voices\Tokens\{VoiceName}
#
# 2. Each voice token has a CLSID (COM class ID) that points to a DLL
#    The CLSID is registered under:
#    HKLM\SOFTWARE\Classes\CLSID\{CLSID}\InprocServer32 → DLL path
#
# 3. The full chain is:
#    App calls SAPI → SAPI reads Registry → Finds CLSID → Finds DLL → Loads DLL → Calls Speak()
#
# 4. For VoiceLink, we need to:
#    a) Create our own CLSID
#    b) Build a DLL that implements ISpTTSEngine
#    c) Register it in both locations in the Registry
#    d) Our DLL forwards text to our AI server and returns audio
