# ============================================================================
# VoiceLink Research - Step 02: Kokoro Neural TTS Test
# ============================================================================
#
# PURPOSE: Generate speech with Kokoro neural TTS and compare it to SAPI voices.
# This demonstrates the quality difference that VoiceLink will bring.
#
# WHAT IS KOKORO?
# - A lightweight neural TTS model (~80MB)
# - Uses a transformer-based architecture
# - Supports multiple voices out of the box
# - Apache 2.0 license (free for commercial use)
# - Fast inference — works great on both CPU and GPU
#
# HOW NEURAL TTS WORKS (simplified):
# 1. Text → Phonemes (linguistic analysis)
# 2. Phonemes → Mel Spectrogram (acoustic model / transformer)
# 3. Mel Spectrogram → Waveform (vocoder / decoder)
#
# The result sounds natural because the model learned from thousands of hours
# of real human speech, capturing rhythm, intonation, and emotion.
