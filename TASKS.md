## Phase 0: Research and Deep Understanding
**Goal:** Before writing a single line of production code, understand every layer of the system deeply.

### 0.1 — Understand Windows SAPI (Speech API)
> *What is SAPI? How does Windows discover and use voices? What interfaces must we implement?*

- [x] **Research: What is SAPI 5?**
  - Read Microsoft SAPI 5.4 documentation
  - Understand the difference between SAPI 4, SAPI 5, and OneCore voices
  - Document: How does an app like Thorium Reader find available voices?
  - Learning: Registry keys involved (`HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Speech\Voices\Tokens\`)
  - ✅ Documented in DEEP_DIVE.md Section 2

- [x] **Research: The ISpTTSEngine Interface**
  - What methods must a TTS engine implement?
  - `Speak()`, `GetOutputFormat()`, `SetObjectToken()` — what does each do?
  - How does SAPI pass text to the engine? (plain text vs SSML)
  - How does the engine return audio? (`ISpTTSEngineSite::Write()`)
  - ✅ Documented in DEEP_DIVE.md Section 2

- [x] **Research: COM (Component Object Model) Fundamentals**
  - What is COM? Why does Windows use it for plugins?
  - IUnknown, IClassFactory, reference counting
  - GUIDs, CLSIDs, ProgIDs — what are they?
  - How does DllRegisterServer work?
  - How does `CoCreateInstance` find and load our DLL?
  - ✅ Documented in DEEP_DIVE.md Section 3

- [x] **Research: Audio Formats in SAPI**
  - What audio formats does SAPI expect? (PCM, sample rates)
  - What is `WAVEFORMATEX`?
  - How does streaming work — can we send audio in chunks?
  - Latency requirements — how fast must first audio arrive?
  - ✅ Documented in DEEP_DIVE.md Section 7

- [x] **Experiment: List all SAPI voices on my system**
  - Write a small Python/PowerShell script using `win32com` or `pyttsx3`
  - List all installed voices, their properties, registry entries
  - Try speaking with each voice, observe the API calls
  - ✅ Script: `research/01_explore_sapi.ps1`. Found David, Zira, 7 OneCore voices.

- [ ] **Experiment: Inspect Thorium Reader's TTS usage**
  - How does Thorium call SAPI? (Electron + SAPI bridge?)
  - Does it use SSML or plain text?
  - What audio format does it request?
  - Use Process Monitor to trace the COM calls

### 0.2 — Understand Neural TTS Models
> *How do modern TTS models work? What are our options? What are the tradeoffs?*

- [x] **Research: How Neural TTS Works (High Level)**
  - Text → Tokens → Mel Spectrogram → Waveform
  - What is a vocoder? (HiFi-GAN, etc.)
  - Difference between autoregressive and non-autoregressive models
  - What determines voice quality vs speed?
  - ✅ Documented in DEEP_DIVE.md Section 4

- [x] **Survey: Open-Source TTS Models**
  - Evaluate each on: quality, speed, license, ease of use, voice cloning
  - **Kokoro** — Small, fast, Apache 2.0, multiple voices
  - **Piper** — Optimized for Raspberry Pi, very fast, many languages
  - **Qwen-3 TTS** — Large model, highest quality, needs GPU
  - **Coqui/XTTS** — Voice cloning capable
  - **F5-TTS** — Zero-shot voice cloning
  - **Parler-TTS** — Describe the voice you want in natural language
  - ✅ Documented in DEEP_DIVE.md Section 5 & 6

- [x] **Experiment: Run Kokoro locally**
  - Install dependencies, download model
  - Generate speech from text, measure latency and quality
  - Test streaming output — can we get audio chunk by chunk?
  - ✅ Script: `research/02_kokoro_test.py`. 4 voices tested, quality verified.

- [ ] **Experiment: Run Piper locally** *(Skipped — user tested Piper previously, prefers Kokoro)*

- [ ] **Research: ONNX Runtime for TTS** *(Future — Kokoro PyTorch works well for now)*

### 0.3 — Understand the Audio Pipeline
> *How does audio flow from a TTS model to the user's speakers through SAPI?*

- [x] **Research: PCM Audio Basics**
  - Sample rate, bit depth, channels
  - How to calculate buffer sizes
  - WAV file format structure
  - ✅ Documented in DEEP_DIVE.md Section 7

- [x] **Research: Audio Streaming**
  - Chunked audio delivery vs full buffer
  - Ring buffers and double buffering
  - Latency vs quality tradeoffs
  - ✅ Implemented in server — chunked transfer encoding via StreamingResponse

- [x] **Research: SAPI Audio Sink**
  - How does `ISpTTSEngineSite::Write()` work?
  - Can we send partial audio? How often?
  - What happens if audio arrives too slowly?
  - ✅ Documented in DEEP_DIVE.md Section 2

### 0.4 — Study Existing Projects
> *Who has done something similar? What can we learn from them?*

- [x] **Study: NaturalVoiceSAPIAdapter (680★, C++)**
  - Bridges Azure Neural voices → SAPI via COM DLL
  - Key learnings: SPVTEXTFRAG→SSML building, cancel handling, 24kHz PCM streaming
  - ✅ Documented in DEEP_DIVE.md Section 9

- [x] **Study: windows-text-to-speech (Rust)**
  - SAPI engine in Rust with Piper support
  - Confirmed: modern SpeechSynthesizer API is locked to MS-signed voices
  - ✅ Documented in DEEP_DIVE.md Section 9

- [x] **Study: PySpTTSEnginePoC (Python)**
  - Pure Python COM TTS engine using comtypes
  - Good for learning, too fragile for production (out-of-process, crashy)
  - ✅ Documented in DEEP_DIVE.md Section 9

## Phase 1: TTS Inference Server
**Goal:** Build a local server that takes text and returns high-quality streaming audio.

### 1.1 — Server Foundation
- [x] Set up Python project with FastAPI
- [x] Define API contract (`POST /v1/tts` with text, voice, format params)
- [ ] WebSocket endpoint for streaming audio *(deferred — HTTP streaming works well)*
- [x] Health check endpoint (`GET /v1/health`)
- [x] Configuration system (model selection, GPU/CPU, port) — `server/config.py`

### 1.2 — Model Integration
- [x] Integrate Kokoro as first model — `server/models/kokoro_model.py`
- [x] Abstract model interface (so we can swap models) — `server/models/base.py`
- [ ] Integrate Piper as second model
- [ ] Model download and management system

### 1.3 — Streaming and Performance

---

## Phase 5: Ship and Iterate
**Goal:** Get it into real users' hands and improve based on feedback.

- [ ] GitHub Release v0.1.0 with installer
- [ ] Write announcement post (Reddit r/epub, r/accessibility, r/programming)
- [ ] Collect feedback
- [ ] Plan v0.2.0 features (voice cloning? more models? Linux support?)

## Notes and Decisions Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|

| 2026-02-28 | Name: VoiceLink | Clean, memorable, describes the bridge concept |
| 2026-02-28 | Learning-first approach | Understanding every layer matters more than shipping fast |
| 2026-02-28 | Skipped Piper | User tested Piper previously, prefers Kokoro quality |
| 2026-02-28 | Architecture: Hybrid C++ COM + Python server | Best balance of reliability (C++ COM) and flexibility (Python ML) |
| 2026-02-28 | UX: Single .exe installer | A 10th-grader should be able to set it up — no terminal, no Python |
| 2026-02-28 | Server port: 7860 | Avoids common conflicts, easy to remember |
| 2026-02-28 | Audio format: 24kHz 16-bit mono | Matches both Kokoro output and SAPI SPSF_24kHz16BitMono — no resampling |
