# ============================================================================
# VoiceLink — Abstract TTS Model Interface
# ============================================================================
#
# WHY AN ABSTRACT BASE CLASS?
# We want to support multiple TTS backends (Kokoro, Qwen-3, Piper, etc.)
# without changing any server code. Each model just implements this interface.
#
# THE KEY INSIGHT:
# Every TTS model does fundamentally the same thing:
#   text + voice → audio samples (PCM)
#
# The differences are in HOW they do it internally. The abstract interface
# hides those differences behind a common API. This is the "Strategy Pattern."
#
# STREAMING:
# synthesize() returns a Generator that yields PCM byte chunks. This is
# critical for low latency — the COM DLL can start playing audio before
# the model finishes generating the entire sentence.
