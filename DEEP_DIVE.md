## 1. The Problem Space

### What Apps Use SAPI?

Any Windows app that calls the system TTS goes through SAPI. Known apps:

| App | How It Uses TTS | Notes |
|-----|----------------|-------|
| **Thorium Reader** | Read Aloud for EPUB/PDF | Electron app, uses Windows SAPI via IPC. This is our primary target. |
| **Microsoft Edge** | Read Aloud feature | Interestingly, Edge can ALSO use cloud Azure voices (not just SAPI). |
| **Windows Narrator** | Full screen reader for accessibility | Uses both SAPI and OneCore voices. |
| **Balabolka** | Dedicated TTS app, reads any text/document | Power-user app, explicitly picks SAPI voices. |
| **Calibre** | E-book reader with TTS plugin | Via plugin, uses SAPI. |
| **NVDA** | Screen reader for visually impaired | Open-source, uses SAPI + eSpeak. |
| **JAWS** | Commercial screen reader | Uses SAPI + its own Eloquence engine. |
| **PowerShell/C#** | `System.Speech.Synthesis.SpeechSynthesizer` | .NET wrapper around SAPI. |
| **VBA/Office** | Macros can call SAPI | `CreateObject("SAPI.SpVoice")`. |

**Key insight:** If we register one SAPI voice, ALL of these apps get upgraded automatically. That's the leverage.

### Why Built-in Voices Sound Bad

Microsoft's desktop SAPI voices (David, Zira) use **concatenative synthesis** — a 2000s-era approach:
1. Record a human saying thousands of phoneme combinations
2. At runtime, stitch together the right phoneme clips
3. Apply basic smoothing at the joins

The result: each individual sound is human, but the stitching creates that characteristic robotic cadence. There's no natural rhythm, no emotion, no prosody variation.

Microsoft's **OneCore voices** (Mark, Heera, etc.) are slightly better — they use a basic neural approach — but they're still nowhere near modern open-source models.

Microsoft's **Azure Neural voices** (used in Edge's cloud Read Aloud) are actually very good, but they require an internet connection and a paid API. Our project brings that quality level to SAPI — locally, free, offline.

## 2. Windows Speech Architecture

### SAPI 5 (Speech API version 5)

- **Introduced:** Windows XP, 2001
- **Current version:** SAPI 5.4 (Windows 10/11)
- **What it is:** A COM-based API for both speech recognition (STT) and speech synthesis (TTS)
- **Where it lives:** `%SystemRoot%\System32\Speech\` and `Speech_OneCore\`

### The Two Voice Registries

Windows has **two separate** locations for TTS voices:

```
1. Classic SAPI 5 (Desktop voices):
   HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Speech\Voices\Tokens\
   → David, Zira
   → Any app using System.Speech or SAPI COM can see these

2. OneCore (Modern voices):
   HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Speech_OneCore\Voices\Tokens\
   → David, Zira, Mark, Heera, Ravi, Hemant, Kalpana (on our system)
   → UWP apps and newer APIs can see these
   → NOT always visible to classic SAPI 5 apps
```

**For VoiceLink**, we register in the **classic SAPI 5 path** — that ensures maximum compatibility with apps like Thorium Reader.

### Voice Token Structure (What We Discovered)

From our exploration on 2026-02-28, each voice token has:

```
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Speech\Voices\Tokens\TTS_MS_EN-US_DAVID_11.0
    (default)  = "Microsoft David Desktop - English (United States)"
    409        = "Microsoft David Desktop - English (United States)"   ← locale-specific name
    CLSID      = {179F3D56-1B0B-42B2-A962-59B7EF59FE1B}              ← COM class ID
    VoicePath  = C:\WINDOWS\Speech_OneCore\Engines\TTS\en-US\M1033David
    LangDataPath = C:\WINDOWS\Speech_OneCore\Engines\TTS\en-US\MSTTSLocEnUS.dat
```

And the CLSID maps to a DLL:

```
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Classes\CLSID\{179F3D56-1B0B-42B2-A962-59B7EF59FE1B}\InprocServer32
    (default)      = C:\Windows\System32\speech_onecore\engines\tts\MSTTSEngine_OneCore.dll
    ThreadingModel = Both
```

**Crucial finding:** ALL OneCore voices share the same CLSID/DLL (`{179F3D56-...}` / `MSTTSEngine_OneCore.dll`). The single DLL loads different voice data based on the `VoicePath`. This is the pattern we'll follow — one VoiceLink DLL, multiple voice tokens.

### SAPI COM Interfaces We Must Implement

| Interface | Purpose | Key Methods |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `IUnknown` | Base COM interface (all COM objects) | `QueryInterface()`, `AddRef()`, `Release()` |
| `ISpTTSEngine` | The TTS engine itself | `Speak()`, `GetOutputFormat()` |
| `ISpObjectWithToken` | Receives configuration from the voice token | `SetObjectToken()`, `GetObjectToken()` |
| `IClassFactory` | Creates instances of our engine | `CreateInstance()`, `LockServer()` |

### How `Speak()` Works (The Core Flow)

```cpp
HRESULT Speak(
    DWORD dwSpeakFlags,           // Flags (async, SSML, etc.)
    REFGUID rguidFormatId,        // Requested audio format
    const WAVEFORMATEX *pWaveFormatEx,  // Audio format details
    const SPVTEXTFRAG *pTextFragList,   // Linked list of text fragments
    ISpTTSEngineSite *pOutputSite       // Where to write audio output
);
```

- `pTextFragList`: SAPI breaks the text into fragments. Each fragment has the text and optional SSML attributes (rate, pitch, volume changes).
- `pOutputSite`: This is our audio sink. We call `pOutputSite->Write(audioData, byteCount)` to send audio back. We can call it multiple times for streaming.

## 3. COM (Component Object Model)

### What Is COM?

- **Created by:** Microsoft, early 1990s
- **Purpose:** Language-neutral binary standard for component interop
- **Still used in:** DirectX, Shell extensions, Office, SAPI, Windows Runtime (WinRT is built on COM)
- **Key idea:** Define interfaces (vtables) at the binary level, so any language can implement or call them

### Core Concepts

**Interface:** A contract — a list of method signatures. Defined in IDL (Interface Definition Language) or in C++ as abstract classes with pure virtual functions. Every interface inherits from `IUnknown`.

**CLSID (Class ID):** A 128-bit GUID that uniquely identifies a COM class. Example: `{179F3D56-1B0B-42B2-A962-59B7EF59FE1B}`.

**GUID (Globally Unique Identifier):** A 128-bit number guaranteed to be unique across space and time. Generated using algorithms based on MAC address + timestamp or random numbers. Format: `{XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX}`.

**vtable (Virtual Method Table):** The binary layout of an interface. It's literally an array of function pointers in memory. This is why COM works across languages — any language that can call a function pointer at a memory offset can use COM.

```
Memory layout of a COM object:
┌──────────────┐
│ pVtable ──────────► ┌──────────────────────┐
├──────────────┤       │ QueryInterface ptr   │  offset 0
│ ref_count    │       │ AddRef ptr           │  offset 4
│ internal_data│       │ Release ptr          │  offset 8
└──────────────┘       │ Speak ptr            │  offset 12
                       │ GetOutputFormat ptr  │  offset 16
                       └──────────────────────┘
```

**IUnknown — The Root of Everything:**

```cpp
interface IUnknown {
    HRESULT QueryInterface(REFIID riid, void **ppvObject);  // "Do you support interface X?"
    ULONG AddRef();                                          // "I'm using you"
    ULONG Release();                                         // "I'm done" (destroy if count hits 0)
};
```

**In-Process Server (InprocServer32):** A COM component packaged as a DLL that runs inside the caller's process. This is what we're building. It's fast because there's no inter-process communication — SAPI loads our DLL directly.

**Registration:** COM components must be registered in the Windows Registry so `CoCreateInstance()` can find them. Our DLL will export `DllRegisterServer()` which writes the registry entries.

## 4. Neural TTS — How It Works

### The Three-Stage Pipeline

All modern neural TTS follows roughly this pipeline:

```
┌──────────┐     ┌──────────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│   TEXT    │ ──► │  ACOUSTIC MODEL  │ ──► │  VOCODER    │ ──► AUDIO
│ Frontend  │     │  (Neural Network) │     │ (Waveform   │
│           │     │                    │     │  Generator) │
│ "Hello"   │     │ Phonemes + Style  │     │ Mel → PCM  │
│   ↓       │     │   ↓                │     │             │
│ /həloʊ/  │     │ Mel Spectrogram    │     │ 24kHz PCM  │
└──────────┘     └──────────────────┘     └─────────────┘
```

### Stage 1: Text Frontend / Linguistic Analysis

Converts raw text to a linguistic representation:

- **Normalization:** "Dr. Smith bought 3 apples for $4.50" → "Doctor Smith bought three apples for four dollars and fifty cents"
- **Grapheme-to-Phoneme (G2P):** "hello" → /həˈloʊ/ (IPA phonemes)
  - English is notoriously hard — "read" has two pronunciations
  - Uses lookup dictionaries (CMUDict) + learned rules for unknown words
- **Prosody prediction:** Where to place stress, pauses, intonation curves

**Kokoro uses Misaki** for this stage (see section 6).

### Stage 2: Acoustic Model

The core neural network. Takes phonemes + speaker embedding → produces mel spectrogram.

**What is a mel spectrogram?**
- A 2D representation of sound: X-axis = time, Y-axis = frequency (mel scale), value = energy
- "Mel scale" maps frequencies to how humans perceive pitch (we're more sensitive to low-frequency differences)
- Typically 80 mel bands, one frame every 10-12ms
- It's essentially a "recipe" for the sound, but not the sound itself

**Architectures:**
- **Tacotron 2** (2017, Google) — The breakthrough. Autoregressive (generates one frame at a time). Slow.
- **FastSpeech 2** (2020, Microsoft) — Non-autoregressive (generates all frames at once). 10-100x faster.
- **VITS** (2021) — End-to-end, combines acoustic model + vocoder. Used by Piper.
- **StyleTTS 2** (2023) — Style-based, excellent prosody. **Used by Kokoro.**
- **Matcha-TTS** (2024) — Flow-matching based, very fast and high quality.

### Stage 3: Vocoder

Converts mel spectrogram → actual audio waveform.

- **WaveNet** (2016, DeepMind) — First neural vocoder. Autoregressive. Very slow.
- **WaveRNN** (2018) — Lighter, faster.
- **HiFi-GAN** (2020) — GAN-based, fast, high quality. Used by many TTS systems.
- **iSTFT-based** (2022+) — Uses inverse Short-Time Fourier Transform. Very fast, good quality. **Used by Kokoro.**

### Voice Embeddings

How one model produces multiple voices:
- Each voice is encoded as a **fixed-size vector** (e.g., 256 dimensions)
- This vector captures: pitch range, speaking rate, breathiness, formant structure, accent
- At inference time, the vector is fed into the acoustic model as a conditioning signal
- The model produces output "in the style of" that voice vector

This is why Kokoro can have many voices with one ~82MB model — each voice is just a small embedding file.

### Qwen-3 TTS (by Alibaba / Qwen Team)

| Property | Details |
|----------|---------|
| **Creator** | Alibaba Cloud / Qwen Team |
| **Architecture** | Large language model based TTS (decoder-only transformer) |
| **Model sizes** | Expected: 0.5B, 2B, 7B parameters |
| **Languages** | Multilingual (Chinese, English, Japanese, Korean, and many more) |
| **Sample rate** | Likely 24,000 Hz |
| **License** | TBD — Qwen models are typically Apache 2.0 or Qwen License |
| **HuggingFace** | Qwen/ namespace |
| **Speed** | Slower than Kokoro — LLM-based, benefits heavily from GPU |
| **Voice cloning** | Expected: zero-shot voice cloning from audio prompt |
| **Quality** | Expected: state-of-the-art, near indistinguishable from human |

**Why Qwen-3 TTS is exciting:**
- It's LLM-based — the TTS model IS a large language model that outputs audio tokens
- This means it understands context, emphasis, emotion much better than traditional TTS
- It can potentially handle things like: dialogue (different character voices), questions (rising intonation), sarcasm, excitement
- Zero-shot voice cloning: give it a 10-second audio sample, and it speaks in that voice

**Tradeoffs vs Kokoro:**
- Much larger (GBs vs 82MB)
- Slower inference (needs good GPU)
- Higher quality, especially for expressive/emotional speech
- More VRAM needed (4-16GB depending on model size)

**Our plan:** Use as "Premium" voice option for users with strong GPUs.

## 6. Companies & Organizations

### Hexgrad

- **What:** Individual developer / small team behind Kokoro TTS
- **Created:** Kokoro TTS, Misaki (text frontend)
- **Philosophy:** Small, efficient models that punch above their weight
- **Why they matter to us:** Kokoro is our primary voice engine. Apache 2.0 license means we can ship it freely.
- **Misaki:** Their text-to-phoneme library. Handles English (with CMUDict), Japanese, Chinese, etc. Replaces eSpeak for phoneme generation.

### Alibaba / Qwen Team

- **What:** AI research division of Alibaba Cloud (Chinese tech giant)
- **Based in:** Hangzhou, China
- **Created:** Qwen series of LLMs (Qwen, Qwen-2, Qwen-2.5, Qwen-3), Qwen-Audio, Qwen-TTS
- **Why they matter:** Qwen-3 TTS represents the next generation — LLM-native TTS. If they release it open-source (likely, given their track record), it could be the best open TTS model.
- **License history:** Qwen-1 was restrictive, Qwen-2+ moved to Apache 2.0. Good trend.

### Rhasspy / Michael Hansen

- **What:** Open-source voice assistant project
- **Created:** Piper TTS, Wyoming protocol, Rhasspy voice assistant
- **Philosophy:** Voice tech should run locally, on cheap hardware, with no cloud dependency
- **Funded by:** Nabu Casa (Home Assistant)
- **Why they matter:** Piper proved neural TTS can run on a $35 Raspberry Pi. Inspiration for efficiency.

### Microsoft

- **SAPI team:** Built the Speech API (1995-present). Now part of Windows Core.
- **Azure AI Speech:** Cloud-based neural TTS. Excellent quality but requires internet + paid API.
- **Important distinction:** SAPI desktop voices (David, Zira) ≠ Azure Neural voices. The desktop ones are old tech.
- **OneCore:** The middle ground. Better than SAPI desktop, worse than Azure Neural. Introduced with Windows 10.

### Hugging Face

- **What:** AI model hub + research company
- **Based in:** New York / Paris
- **Created:** Transformers library, Diffusers, Parler-TTS, model hub
- **Why they matter:** Most open-source TTS models are hosted on Hugging Face Hub. Kokoro downloads from there. It's the npm/pip of AI models.

### SWivid (F5-TTS)

- **What:** Research team/group
- **Created:** F5-TTS (flow-matching TTS with voice cloning)
- **Why they matter:** Pushed zero-shot voice cloning quality forward significantly
- **Caveat:** Non-commercial license limits our ability to include it in VoiceLink

### Coqui AI (Defunct)

- **What was:** Berlin-based TTS startup, spun out of Mozilla's voice team
- **Rose:** 2021-2023, created XTTS (excellent multi-lingual voice cloning)
- **Fell:** January 2024, company shut down
- **Legacy:** Their TTS library and XTTS model remain open-source on GitHub
- **Lesson:** Pure TTS is hard to monetize as a standalone business

## 7. Audio Engineering

### PCM Audio Basics

**PCM (Pulse Code Modulation):** The standard raw digital audio format.

- **Sample:** A single measurement of the audio waveform at a point in time
- **Sample rate:** How many measurements per second (Hz)
  - 8,000 Hz — telephone quality
  - 16,000 Hz — typical for STT/SAPI
  - 22,050 Hz — common for older TTS
  - 24,000 Hz — **Kokoro's output**
  - 44,100 Hz — CD quality
  - 48,000 Hz — professional audio / video
- **Bit depth:** Precision of each sample
  - 16-bit — standard (range: -32768 to 32767)
  - 32-bit float — used internally by neural models (range: -1.0 to 1.0)
- **Channels:** 1 = mono, 2 = stereo. TTS is always mono.

**Calculating data rates:**
```
Bytes per second = sample_rate × (bit_depth / 8) × channels

Kokoro output:    24000 × 2 × 1 = 48,000 bytes/sec = 48 KB/s
SAPI 16kHz 16bit: 16000 × 2 × 1 = 32,000 bytes/sec = 32 KB/s
```

### WAV File Format

```
RIFF header (12 bytes):
  "RIFF" + file_size + "WAVE"

fmt chunk (24 bytes):
  "fmt " + chunk_size + audio_format(1=PCM) + channels + sample_rate
  + byte_rate + block_align + bits_per_sample

data chunk (variable):
  "data" + data_size + [raw PCM samples...]
```

### Resampling (24kHz → 16kHz)

SAPI may request audio at 16kHz or 22kHz. Kokoro outputs at 24kHz. We need to convert.

**Resampling** = changing the sample rate of audio. For downsampling (24k→16k):
1. Apply a low-pass filter (anti-aliasing) to remove frequencies above the new Nyquist (8kHz)
2. Resample by interpolation

Python library: `scipy.signal.resample` or `librosa.resample`. We'll do this in the inference server.

### WAVEFORMATEX (SAPI's Audio Format Struct)

```cpp
typedef struct {
    WORD  wFormatTag;      // 1 = PCM
    WORD  nChannels;       // 1 = mono
    DWORD nSamplesPerSec;  // sample rate
    DWORD nAvgBytesPerSec; // sample_rate * block_align
    WORD  nBlockAlign;     // channels * (bits_per_sample / 8)
    WORD  wBitsPerSample;  // 16
    WORD  cbSize;          // 0 for PCM
} WAVEFORMATEX;
```

Our DLL's `GetOutputFormat()` will fill this struct to tell SAPI what format our audio is in.

---

## 8. Key Specifications & Formats

### SSML (Speech Synthesis Markup Language)

Some apps send SSML instead of plain text:

```xml
<speak version="1.0" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/10/synthesis" xml:lang="en-US">
  <voice name="VoiceLink-Kokoro">
    <prosody rate="slow" pitch="high">
      Once upon a time...
    </prosody>
    <break time="500ms"/>
    There lived a girl named Alice.
  </voice>
</speak>
```

Our engine needs to parse SSML or at minimum strip it to plain text. Kokoro/Misaki has basic SSML support.

### Language Codes (LCID)

| Hex Code | Language |
|----------|----------|
| `0x0409` | en-US (English, United States) |
| `0x0809` | en-GB (English, United Kingdom) |
| `0x0411` | ja-JP (Japanese) |
| `0x0804` | zh-CN (Chinese, Simplified) |

These appear in voice token registration (`409` = en-US for David/Zira).

## 9. Related Projects & Prior Art

### Projects That Have Done Something Similar

We researched GitHub on 2026-02-28 for projects that bridge custom/neural TTS into SAPI. Here's what exists:

| Project | Stars | Language | Approach | Status |
|---------|-------|----------|----------|--------|
| **NaturalVoiceSAPIAdapter** | 680 | C++ | Bridges Azure Neural voices to SAPI via COM DLL | Active, mature |
| **windows-text-to-speech** | 11 | Rust | SAPI engine DLL with Piper TTS support | Active |
| **PySpTTSEnginePoC** | 0 | Python | Pure Python COM SAPI engine using comtypes | PoC, inactive |

### NaturalVoiceSAPIAdapter (gexgd0419) — The Gold Standard

**Repo:** https://github.com/gexgd0419/NaturalVoiceSAPIAdapter

The most successful project in this space (680 stars). It makes Azure Neural TTS voices (Microsoft's cloud voices) available to any SAPI 5 app.

**Architecture:**
- C++ COM DLL implementing `ISpTTSEngine`
- Connects to Azure Speech SDK (for local embedded voices) OR REST API (for cloud voices)
- Builds SSML from SAPI `SPVTEXTFRAG` linked list
- Handles: cancel, skip, sentence boundaries, bookmark events, silence compensation
- Output format: `SPSF_24kHz16BitMono` (24kHz, 16-bit, mono)
- Has an installer and a settings GUI window
- Codebase: ~5000 lines of C++

**Key findings from studying their code:**
1. They use 24kHz 16-bit mono — same as Kokoro's native output. No resampling needed.
2. The SSML building from `SPVTEXTFRAG` is non-trivial — handles rate, pitch, volume changes from SAPI.
3. They handle cancellation (`SPVES_ABORT`) by checking `pOutputSite->GetActions()` in a loop.
4. Audio is streamed chunk-by-chunk to `pOutputSite->Write()`.
5. Silence compensation: when switching between sentences, they calculate trailing silence and compensate for network delay.
6. Error handling: all C++ exceptions are caught at the COM boundary and converted to `HRESULT`.

**Key limitation that creates our opportunity:**
- Requires internet connection for cloud voices
- Requires Azure subscription key ($) for non-Edge voices
- Local embedded voices require Microsoft's limited-access SDK license
- **VoiceLink fills this gap: same architecture, but local, free, with open-source models**

### windows-text-to-speech (Lej77) — Rust Approach

**Repo:** https://github.com/Lej77/windows-text-to-speech

A Rust implementation supporting Piper TTS as a SAPI voice.

**Key findings:**
- Rust COM is viable using the `windows` crate, but complex
- They catalogued all Kokoro Rust crates: `sherpa-rs`, `kokoros`/`kokorox`, `kokoro-tts`, `kokoroxide`, `kokoro-tiny`
- Installation via `regsvr32 ./windows_tts_engine.dll`
- Piper requires eSpeak NG data files — dependency management is messy
- Has a comprehensive README with all the SAPI reference links we need:
  - [TTS Engine Vendor Porting Guide (SAPI 5.3)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/ms717037(v=vs.85))
  - [ISpTTSEngine Interface Reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/ms717235(v=vs.85))
  - [Sample Engines (SAPI 5.3)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/ms720179(v=vs.85))

**Important note from their README:**
> The modern `Windows.Media.SpeechSynthesis.SpeechSynthesizer` API has a remark:
> "Only Microsoft-signed voices installed on the system can be used to generate speech."
>
> So the modern API is locked down. **SAPI 5 (legacy) is the only path for custom voices.**

### PySpTTSEnginePoC (bostjanv) — Python Proof of Concept

**Repo:** https://github.com/bostjanv/PySpTTSEnginePoC

A minimal proof-of-concept showing you CAN implement SAPI TTS in Python.

**How it works:**
- Uses Python `comtypes` library to implement COM interfaces
- Defines the SAPI interfaces in an IDL file (`pysapi.idl`), compiles with MIDL
- Generates Python COM type definitions with `comtypes`
- The "TTS" just plays a pre-recorded WAV file on every `Speak()` call
- Registers the voice via Python (`winreg` module)
- Only ~200 lines of Python

**Key findings:**
- It works, but runs as a COM **local server** (out-of-process), not in-process
- Must run `python sapi_tts_engine.py /regserver` as admin to register
- Python process must be running for the voice to work
- Fragile: if Python crashes, the voice disappears silently
- Good for learning, not for production

**Their register_voice() function is a perfect reference** for the registry entries we need:
```python
paths = [
    f"SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Speech\\Voices\\Tokens\\{id}",
    f"SOFTWARE\\WOW6432Node\\Microsoft\\Speech\\Voices\\Tokens\\{id}"
]
# Must register in BOTH paths for 64-bit and 32-bit app compatibility
```

### Other Notable References

- **eSpeak SAPI support:** The original eSpeak had SAPI 5 integration. eSpeak-ng (the modern fork) does NOT — [Issue #7](https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng/issues/7) has been open since 2015 with useful discussion.
- **Microsoft Speech Platform:** A separate installable runtime (not built into Windows) that provides additional voices. Some are better than David/Zira. Not widely known.
- **sherpa-onnx:** A C++/Rust/Python toolkit by k2-fsa that runs many TTS models (including Kokoro) via ONNX Runtime. Could be useful for a single-binary approach later.

## 10. Architecture Decision

### Date: 2026-02-28

### Decision: Hybrid Architecture (C++ COM DLL + Python Inference Server)

After studying all three existing projects and evaluating four possible approaches, we chose the **Hybrid** architecture.

### Options Evaluated

| Approach | Reliability | Speed | Ease of Dev | Model Flexibility | User Setup |
|----------|-----------|-------|-------------|-------------------|------------|
| **A. Pure Python (comtypes COM)** | Poor — fragile, crashes | Slow (out-of-process IPC) | Fast to build | Excellent | Complex (needs Python) |
| **B. Pure C++ (single binary + ONNX)** | Excellent | Fastest | Very slow to build | Poor (recompile to change) | Simple (.dll) |
| **C. Pure Rust** | Good | Fast | Slow (COM is complex in Rust) | Moderate | Simple (.dll) |
| **D. Hybrid: C++ COM DLL + Python server** | Excellent | Fast (~2ms overhead) | Moderate | Excellent | Simple (installer bundles everything) |

### Why Hybrid Wins

**The bottleneck is ALWAYS the model inference (~100-500ms), never the COM layer (~0.1ms) or HTTP (~2ms).** So:

1. **COM layer (C++) must be rock-solid** — it loads into every SAPI app's process. If it crashes, the app crashes. C++ in-process COM is the proven standard (NaturalVoiceSAPIAdapter proves this with 680 stars).

2. **Inference layer (Python) must be flexible** — switching from Kokoro to Qwen-3 should be a config change, not a recompile. Python has the ML ecosystem. GPU management is trivial.

3. **The HTTP/WebSocket bridge between them is negligible** — ~2ms localhost overhead vs 100ms+ inference. And it gives us clean separation: update the server without touching the COM DLL.

### Latency Budget

```
COM call overhead:        ~0.1 ms
HTTP request/response:    ~2 ms
Kokoro inference (GPU):   ~100-300 ms  (for first chunk)
Kokoro inference (CPU):   ~300-800 ms  (for first chunk)
Streaming chunk overhead:  ~1 ms per chunk
────────────────────────────────────
Total time to first audio: ~102-802 ms
Subsequent chunks:         ~10-50 ms each (pipeline effect)
```

For comparison: NaturalVoiceSAPIAdapter with Azure cloud has ~500-2000ms latency (network). We're faster.

### The Architecture

### Communication Protocol

```
DLL → Server:  POST http://localhost:7860/v1/tts
               Body: { "text": "...", "voice": "af_heart", "format": "pcm_24k_16bit" }
               Response: streaming binary PCM audio (chunked transfer encoding)

DLL → Server:  GET http://localhost:7860/v1/health
               Response: { "status": "ok", "model": "kokoro", "gpu": true }

DLL → Server:  GET http://localhost:7860/v1/voices
               Response: [{ "id": "af_heart", "name": "Heart", "lang": "en-US", ... }]
```

## 11. User Experience Design

### Design Principle: A 10th-Grader Must Be Able to Set It Up

No terminal. No Python. No registry editing. No `pip install`. Just a `.exe`.

### Installation Flow

```
1. User downloads VoiceLink-Setup.exe from GitHub Releases (~150MB)
   (Includes: COM DLL + embedded Python + Kokoro model + tray app)

2. Double-click → Windows installer (NSIS or WiX)
   ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │  Welcome to VoiceLink Setup             │
   │                                         │
   │  VoiceLink adds AI-powered voices to    │
   │  any Windows app that supports          │
   │  text-to-speech.                        │
   │                                         │
   │  [Install]  [Advanced Options]          │
   └─────────────────────────────────────────┘

3. Installer does (behind the scenes):
   a. Copies files to C:\Program Files\VoiceLink\
   b. Extracts embedded Python runtime (not installed system-wide)
   c. Registers voicelink.dll via regsvr32 (creates SAPI voice tokens)
   d. Installs VoiceLink Server as a Windows Service
   e. Creates system tray app shortcut in Startup
   f. Downloads Kokoro model if not bundled (~82MB, with progress bar)

4. Settings window opens automatically:
   ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │  VoiceLink Settings                     │
   │                                         │
   │  ✅ Server running (GPU: RTX 4060)      │
   │                                         │
   │  Voices:                                │
   │  ☑ Kokoro - Heart (Female, warm)        │
   │  ☑ Kokoro - Adam (Male, natural)        │
   │  ☐ Kokoro - Bella (Female, clear)       │
   │  ☐ Kokoro - Michael (Male, deep)        │
   │                                         │
   │  [▶ Test Voice]  [⚙ Advanced]           │
   │                                         │
   │  Models:                                │
   │  ● Kokoro (82MB) — Installed ✓          │
   │  ○ Qwen-3 TTS (2GB) — [Download]       │
   │                                         │
   │  [Save]  [Close to tray]                │
   └─────────────────────────────────────────┘

5. User opens Thorium Reader → Settings → Read Aloud → Voice:
   Now sees "VoiceLink - Heart" alongside "Microsoft David"
   Selects it → clicks Read Aloud → hears AI narration
```

### System Tray Behavior

```
🔗 (tray icon, green = running, red = error, yellow = loading)

Right-click menu:
  ├─ ✅ Server Running
  ├─ ─────────────
  ├─ Open Settings
  ├─ Test Voice
  ├─ ─────────────
  ├─ Start Server
  ├─ Stop Server
  ├─ ─────────────
  └─ Quit VoiceLink
```

### Fallback Behavior

When things go wrong, VoiceLink should fail gracefully:

| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| Server not running | DLL returns `SPERR_UNINITIALIZED`. SAPI falls back to next voice or shows error. |
| Server overloaded | DLL has 5-second timeout. Returns empty audio rather than hanging. |
| Model not downloaded | Server returns HTTP 503. DLL falls back gracefully. |
| GPU not available | Server auto-falls back to CPU. Slower but works. |
| VoiceLink uninstalled | Installer runs `regsvr32 /u`, removes registry entries. Clean. |

### File Structure After Installation

```

### Technology Choices for UX Components

| Component | Technology | Why |
|-----------|-----------|-----|
| Installer | **NSIS** (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System) | Free, lightweight, widely used (VLC, Notepad++ use it). Or **WiX** for MSI. |
| Tray App | **C# WPF** or **Tauri** | WPF: native Windows, small binary. Tauri: web UI, cross-platform potential. |
| Settings GUI | Part of tray app | Keeps it as one process. |
| Server management | Windows Service + named pipe | Tray app monitors service health. |
| Embedded Python | Python embeddable package | Official 15MB zip from python.org. No system-wide install needed. |
